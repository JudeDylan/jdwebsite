All instruments recorded by me (big ups to my mum for the backing vocals though) (:

I hope you all like, I put a lot of effort into this, and I know it is far from Beatles quality but I have definitely progressed in terms of my own recording techniques and experimentation.

I could have done one of those fancy videos showing me playing everything, but oh well maybe next time :)
