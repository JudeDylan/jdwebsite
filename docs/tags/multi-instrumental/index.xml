      <description>All instruments recorded by me (big ups to my mum for the backing vocals though) (:
I hope you all like, I put a lot of effort into this, and I know it is far from Beatles quality but I have definitely progressed in terms of my own recording techniques and experimentation.</description>

      <description>A cover of Oasis&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Half the World Away&amp;rdquo;.
I recorded this a little while ago, and the quality is nowhere near as good as it could have been, however I thought I&amp;rsquo;d still upload it.</description>
